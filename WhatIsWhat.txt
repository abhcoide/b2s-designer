The main projects:
- B2SBackglassDesigner: The Backglass Designer to generate directB2S-Backglasses (This is where you are now)
- B2SBackglassServer: The COM-Server for the communication between VP and Backglass and the display of the Backglasses in the same process
- B2SBackglassServerEXE: Backglass display as separate EXE (for performance reasons). Contains copied code of the server. Communication via the COM-Server and to large parts via the Registry
The last two can be found in their repository at https://github.com/vpinball/b2s-backglass

Tools:
- B2SVPinMAMEStarter: Launches Testmode from the Designer
- directb2sReelSoundsONOFF.cmd: This script will disable the sounds played by the server by telling the server that the sounds do not exist.
